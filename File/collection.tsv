0	In my experience rabbits are very easy to housebreak. They like to pee and poop in the same place every time, so in most cases all you have to do is put a little bit of their waste in the litter box and they will happily use the litter box. It is very important that if they go somewhere else, miss the edge or kick waste out of the box that you clean it up well and immediately as otherwise those spots will become existing places to pee and poop. When you clean the box, save a little bit of waste and put it in the cleaned box so it smells right to them. For a more foolproof method, you can get a piece of wood soaked with their urine and put that in the box along with droppings or cage them so that they are only in their litter box for a week. Generally, if I try the first method and find that they are not using only the box on the first day, I go for the litter box only for a week method. The wood block works well if you are moving from a hutch outdoors to a litter box indoors. If you have an indoor cage, you can use the cage itself as the litter box (or attach a litter box to the section of the cage the rabbit has used for waste.) Be sure to use clay or newsprint litter as the other types aren't necessarily good for rabbits. Wood litter is okay if you are sure it isn't fir. The most important thing is to clean anywhere they have an accident. High sided boxes help with avoiding kicking soiled litter out of the box, which is the biggest cause of failure in my experience.
1	...rabbits can be easily trained to use a litter tray, sometimes with more reliability than your average cat! The natural instinct of a wild rabbit to use one area as its latrine is still apparent in its domestic counterparts. (1) The actual process is very similar to pad training a dog or litter box training a cat. Keep the rabbit confined to a small area while training, move any "accidents" to the litter box, and the rabbit will naturally start using that area for its business. The source link has the details.

2	It could be a multitude of things. Lack of exercise plays a big role in how your dog acts. If they have a lot of unused energy, they're more likely to act up. Giving him treats or praise will encourage the behavior you're trying to prevent. You want to refrain from treats or praise until he's doing what you want him to do. In the mean time, make it clear to him what you want. You want to be the focus of his attention when you come across a child or another dog. You can do this by keeping him right next to you (never in front of you) by using a short leash. If he tries to pull, tilt the leash upwards. Doing so creates unusual pressure on the bottom of his neck, causing him to look up and see what's going on. If he still won't turn his attention to you, you can forcefully nudge him with the side of your leg until he yields. I've found with my dog sometimes I have to step in front of her and hold her muzzle, forcing her to look at me. It's also important that you remain calm. It's easy to get upset and dogs have the ability of reading our emotions. If you're tense and angry, he'll start tune you out.

3	I've had a lot of success with crate training. Dogs won't relieve themselves where they sleep or eat. Keeping them in an enclosed area and bringing them outside when they have to go to relieve themselves teaches them where it's OK to do so. I recommend buying an expandable crate. You want to give them just enough room to stand up and turn around, but not enough that they'll start going in the corner. As they grow you can increase the size of the crate accordingly. The Humane Society has some great info on crate training.
4	I've seen on the "Dog Whisperer" that dogs can sense the anxiety that an owner has. The first thing you need to be aware of is your own anxiety when walking your puppy. As far as your puppy goes, its still a puppy, so fear isn't too unnatural. You will want to acclimate it to walking in urban areas by first training it to walk on a leash well. That means you are walking and your dog happens you be accompanying you. Keep your eyes forward, and heel walk the puppy. If the puppy wanders, give the leash a small yank. As your puppy gets accustomed to this, it should be a lot calmer, and you can try for more noisy environments.
5	@Paperjam is right: crate training is probably the most effective way to quickly housetrain a puppy. I will also add that routine is incredibly important when house-training a puppy. Take your dog out on a schedule: the same times, every day. Also try to take them out shortly after they eat: puppies might have to go as shortly as 30 minutes after a meal. You want to set your pup up for success. Lastly, let me emphasize that accidents will happen. It's natural, it's frustrating, but it's not the end of the world. What you don't want to do is scold your puppy, or "rub their nose in it". Dogs don't really learn that way, and usually just ape your emotions to appease you when they can't figure out what's wrong. It's better to try and prevent such accidents from happening, rather than reacting to one that's already transpired.
6	You can feed cats raw meat, they're obligate carnivores after all, but human processed meats can introduce other bacterias and contaminates into meat that might not be there otherwise. If you want to do this, which I can understand, then you should introduce the raw meats carefully into their diet and only from a source that you trust, such as local butcher who is following good practices (if they save bones for dogs, it's probably a good sign). While you're doing this, monitor your cat carefully and if there is anything happening that concerns you such as unusual stool, vomiting, etc. then stop immediately and potentially take him/her into a vet for a check up. As an aside, there are some really good food products for cats that don't have as much (or little) filling in them. Spend some time reading the labels and look for products that are all meat or very, very high meat volume. Your cats will appreciate it. :)
7	Cats are just like dogs in that they need a lot of exercise. More importantly, they also share the same instinct to kill, except to a much greater degree. I would say that your cat needs one or both of these things to happen: More exercise (buy some interactive toys) Something to "kill" after exercising (and no, don't buy mice just so it can kill them) What I mean by something to kill is a toy or something for it to chew on after some laser chasing or something. If a cat chases after something but can't actually do anything with it, it can build up frustration and aggression.
8	Because the dog is so young, I think it is very likely you can slowly accustom her to urban walking. I think a natural response when you see a small dog cowering or wimpering in fear is to console them, or pet them. This is not an effective way to dissuade fear. It is better to ignore your dog and not feed into its fearful emotions. [see below] I think the best bet is to teach your dog that walking in urban areas is fun. Bring treats and toys, walk in a zany unpredictable way, go for short burts of sprints, etc. Your dog will eventually begin to associate urban walks with fun times and an owner in good spirits. This is not universally agreed-upon among trainers. Some believe this to be true, others believe petting a fearful dog does no harm to the training procedure. I personally subscribe to the theory that you should only pet and praise your dog when she is doing what you want her to be doing.
9	There was a trick Cesar Milan (the Dog Whisperer) used to break a puppy of their fear of living in an urban environment: hold their tail up. When dogs are afraid, their tail tends to go between their legs and their heads bow down. When they're comfortable with their surroundings they'll put their tails upward. Simply (well, not so simply with a dachshund) holding their tail up while walking them might help them to feel more confident. It seems silly but it worked for Cesar. If you have Netflix, I recommend watching episode 2 of The Dog Whisperer: http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/The_Very_Best_of_Dog_Whisperer_with_Cesar_Millan/70270440.
10	I've had a few vets, and all of them say that corn based food is bad. This may be a biased opinion since they each sell some kind of specialty brand pet food. Their explanation is that while domesticated dogs can eat corn based food because they get used to it, their digestive system is built to handle meat. When I asked what other brands aside from the ones they sell would they recommend, almost all of them said Nutro is the best brand to feed a dog. Benefits include: It's easier for them to digest, so they poop less Their coat feels better They shed less When I switched my dogs to Nutro, I've witnessed those results, except for the shedding less, as my dogs don't shed. Keep in mind that Nutro may be an expensive purchase.
11	One theory I've heard is that plastic bags contain the remnants of fats from animal byproducts, which the cats can taste/smell, this seems a little doubtful, though not impossible, given that not all bags are made from petroleum products. Another theory is that the plastic has acquired scents from other substances and the cats are reacting to that. Either theory kind of makes sense; both our cats lick bags all the time. The common connection I see is that the plastic had come in contact with things from the grocery store. This lends a bit of credence to the second theory.
12	I would say that in this case, try not letting the dog go out at night. It may cost you a few nights sleep, but eventually the dog will learn that going out at night isn't allowed. Make sure to take the dog out right before "bed" time so that the dog doesn't resort to going inside the house in anger. Also, crating the dog at night may be an option if the behavior doesn't stop.
13	Cats tend to nibble on you as a sign of affection. As long as they aren't latching on and trying to draw blood/chunks of skin it's not dangerous. If you are dedicated to stopping the behavior I have found that a spray bottle works, but since it may not always be on hand, reducing the opportunities for the cat to nibble on you may also reduce the behavior. You may also find that the cat giving you bites is a cry for attention from the cat and if you regularly play with and pay attention to the cat, the bites may stop all together.
14	Read the coverages carefully. When I investigated pet insurance several years ago, I found that it was only useful for catastrophic costs; the premiums were about equal to the cost of the annual exam (or vet check) and shots, and provided minimal discount there. At that point, you're playing the odds: if your pet develops cancer, you'll be glad to have the insurance, but if it develops something that requires medication, but not surgery, it may not help much. Additionally, there is often an age threshold: for the policies I was looking at, my ten-year-old cats were too old. The best way to evaluate the cost is to compare the premiums and coverage amounts with your past and current data, if you have it, or failing that, with estimates from your vet.
15	While kittens generally can handle dairy products, adult cats usually can't. Feeding cats dairy products can lead to digestive issues resulting in diarrhea or vomiting. Simply stopping giving into the kittens demands would most likely stop this behavior as the cat will learn that their meowing doesn't result in a reward. Backing information on dairy and cats: Human Foods that are Dangerous for Cats (petmd.com)
16	Cheese contains lots of fat, which is a tasty treat for a cat, but it should really be just a treat. I think you probably want to reduce that quantity a bit, maybe to a fifth of that and make it a more special snack instead and look for alternate treats, such as hard treats that will keep his teeth in good shape.
17	Exercise is very important for a young kitten/cat. They should be getting about 1-2 hours a day of exercise. To get them to play just find a game that they both love. For example my kitten will not play unless it is with a mouse. Try buying them a few toys and see which one they like the best.
18	Listing particular products for you will not be helpful. As with most carnivorous pets, what I can suggest is to consider that the ingredients of the food really, really, matter. Dogs are not meant to eat corn or wheat, but many dog food contain some volume of these as filler and as a means to cut costs. What you want to look for are dry or wet food choices that are predominantly meat (proteins) and animal fats. These will help your dog to be healthy and happy, but these choices are also more expensive. You'll typically need to go to a dedicated pet store than a grocery store to purchase them.
19	Daily exercise is good for both your kitten's mental and physical well-being. Exercise can help your baby cat avoid problems with his joints later on in life. Basically, getting your cat in the habit of regular physical activity while he's young is the cornerstone to a long healthy life and helps his physical development. How Much is Enough? Make sure you're consistent with the amount of exercise your kitten gets. You need to help him build its stamina, and the only way he can do this is by exercising regularly but with caution. At the kitten stage, he's much too young to be doing the rigorous activities that he will be more able to do as he grows older. The amount of exercise your kitten needs depends on his age, breed and medical condition. Not every breed will be up for a long walk through Central Park. Some breeds are just not built to go the distance, while others are always ready to romp. But in general You should try to spend about 10-15 minutes a few times each day engaging your cat in some form of activity. Young cats and kittens will usually take the initiative in engaging you in play, or they will find their own entertainment. Take a look at : Exercising with Your Cat: A How-To Guide
20	Rabbits are very clean and easy to train for litter tray use. In nature, rabbits spend a lot of time in hutches and warrens, so learning to use a corner rather than where ever they are keeps their living area clean. This means your job as a rabbit owner is much easier as evolution has done most of the hard work. Most... Finding their "spot" When first house training your rabbit, confine them to a small section of the house, preferable one that is easy to clean such as an area with non-absorbant flooring, like tiles or linoleum - as with all animals, rabbits will make mistakes at first. In this confined area, in the corners you want to play several small litter trays over newspaper to catch any spills. As suggested, if you can, place something that has been soiled into the trays to reinforce the smell - however be careful with which wood you use, why is discussed below in the section on litter. Over time you will notice that your bunny will prefer one spot over another. As they start this preference, slowly remove the other trays one at a time. If they do have accidents in other spots, return the trays and start again. But its very likely your bunny will pick up on whats happening. Once they have a spot chosen, you can get a larger (more elborate) tray, and eventually they will imprint on the litter tray, rather than the area. This allows you to move the litter tray to a more convenient location, or if you need to leave your bunny with someone else the litter tray can go with to reduce mess. Choosing the right litter Rabbits are not cats and some litters designed for cats are not appropriate for rabbits. Above all else, softwood litters such as those based on pine or cedar must be avoided!. Safer choices include paper or hardwoods. Take time to find the right amount of litter for your rabbit, as they all have different preferences. Dealing with mess Number one: loose litter Rabbits have larger and stronger legs than a cat, and a stronger urge to dig. This means that litter, especially used litter, can go flying. The best thing to minimise mess is to get a larger, deeper litter tray. Rabbits will often try to position themselves in a corner when relieving themselves, so positioning the opening in a way away from their chosen corner of the box will help reduce spillage. The below image shows an ideal rabbit litter tray: Do not enclose the litter tray unlike in in nature, your bunnies litter tray is not a porous earthen enclosure with plants that enthusiastically absorb nitrogen. It is non-porous tray that needs to be emptied frequently and if left enclosed will allow nitrogen to build up. Rabbit pee can smell, so more often cleaning, or more absorbent litter is the answer. Enclosing the trya will just enclose the smell, and your rabbits nose is much more sensitive than yours, if the smell builds up too much they will just not go there, and will choose another place to go - like your bed. Number two: "happy trails" Rabbits occasionally suffer from excitement induced fecal incontinence, or cutely known as "happy trails". When excited, whether during positive experiences such you coming home, during feeding time, or new vistors, or negative experiences, such as for some rabbits, nail clippings, your bunny may release dropping pellets. This is outside of their control, and they will usally be very hard and dry, and easy to clean up. This is one of the joys of owning a rabbit. Pampering your rabbit Rabbits are more comfortable in an area when they can eat. So add some hay to their litter box. This also helps to passively position the rabbit into a corner, as rabbits are quite clean and won't relieve themselves on their food. So by positioning the hay in one corner of the box, you encourage the rabbit to go in the opposite one. Waste not want not One a final (slightly off topic) note, as mentioned rabbit waste from a well fed bunny is very high in nitrogen. If you use a recycled paper based litter, the used litter is excellent fertilizer and can be used in the garden, for example to grow nice leafy green vegetables, to feed to your rabbit... thus completing the circle of life.
21	As low as you can get away with. The issue isn't so much with the output, as it is with keeping the laser beam away from the cat's eyes and minimizing the damage in the event that you accidentally shine the laser in the cat's eyes. Same reason behind why it's illegal to shine a laser at a passing airplane, it has the possibility of blinding the pilot.
22	Use the red. All lasers can be dangerous if they hit the eye of a cat or a human, but red lasers are usually much less powerful and still very visible to cats. I'm a little torn on this topic because I've used red lasers as a cat toy lots of times, but it really isn't intended as a cat toy and it's worth remembering that their eyes are far more sensitive than ours. If you do use a laser, just exercise some additional caution.
23	I live in the Caribbean so it's pretty much always hot here and whenever my cat gets restless (constant kneading, meowing, clawing etc). I give him some cool tap water and anytime the fan is on, he likes to sit on the back of my chair apparently enjoying the breeze. He also seems to like the cold floor tiles in the day (I rarely see him on the rug) and at nights I put a hard pillow in his basket and keep it next to a slightly opened window. So, other things I do are to keep curtains closed so that the direct sun can't reach him when I'm not home but keep doors and windows open a bit for the occasional breeze to pass through and also keep his water in an open container in a corner.
24	I have had great luck with Thundershirts in calming my pets, both cats and dogs. If that doesn't work, give the dog a safe place to go, like their crate, may provide some relief. Putting the crate in a location away from the external walls may help some as well.
25	This article from Princeton University deals with laser pointer use and human effect, and it mentions that use of laser pointers that are higher than 5 mW are dangerous and should not be used, so it seems like the green one might be safe, although they recommend that the lower the output the better, as they will be safer. Like with any laser, avoid pointing it at your cat's eyes, or at reflective surfaces that might reflect the laser into their eyes, and that can cause problems, the same way it can for humans. Further, though, beyond just the output, another concern is that since the cats cannot "kill" the laser, they are not able to come down from the "high" of hunting, and may redirect that energy in negative ways (excessive grooming, aggression, etc), so it is suggested that at the end of a laser pointer play session, you give the cat something to "kill" such as a stuffed toy or something similar.
26	No need to refresh your cat, he will be perfectly capable of staying inactive for longer periods of time during the hot hours of the day. They are genetically programmed predators that are good at conserving their energy and finding secluded spots, lurking on their prey in ambush when conditions are too hot and they might exhaust themselves and overheat too fast. Make sure your cat has a shade to retreat to and access to fresh water. The place it stays at should be well ventilated, with fresh air coming into it, preferably with access to the outdoors, if at all possible. Cats will often retreat into the bushes or high grass during the hottest hours of the day, but it's also perfectly normal for them to enjoy a bit of the sun too. Don't worry about their fur getting too hot, it's well insulated and with most cat species, it will take a very long time for that heat to propagate onto their body. Cat species with shorter fur will only have this heat tolerance threshold ever so slightly lower than longer fur ones. They also exchange the heat mostly through breathing and pads, and not through their fur, so perhaps giving your cat access to areas laid with floor tiles or any other cooler surfaces wouldn't be a bad idea either. In short though, as long as your cat has all the essentials provided for, like access to fresh water, shade and well aired areas, they will do all the refreshing on their own well enough even in the hottest of climates during the hottest of hours. Do not use however some water sprinkler or a spray bottle on them with intention of helping them cool down. Cats utterly dislike that and when they learn what to run away from, they will and you'll only achieve the opposite with it, stressing and overheating your cat further.
27	I miss our rabbits, they're great pets... as for treats, I found that veggies made them happy, always. We had pellets for them, which tends to make them chubby, but our rabbits much preferred fresh veggies, especially carrot tops (they love the green more than the orange part, so much for Bugs Bunny) and fresh hay. One thing to really avoid is celery, the strings in the stocks could choke your rabbit. Generally, carrots, dandelion and romaine lettuce were big favourites for our guys and are good for them.
28	Distraction, via food, voice or otherwise, is usually a good way of managing in the short term but in my personal view it can take quite some time before the dog gets the connection if you're using distraction alone and relying on things to happen (i.e. whenever a child happens to pass by). Another short term technique to can be of help is finding an incompatible behaviour, i.e. one that, if he performs that behaviour, he can't exhibit the problem behaviour at the same time. In your case, for example, you might ask your dog to sit and to watch you. Both behaviours are incompatible with lunging, i.e. it can't lunge and sit at the same time. But you'll have to ensure his motivation to keep sitting is higher than his fear of the child. So get not just your average treats but very, very special super yummy sausages, steak, whatever he likes most. This is different from simple distraction, as you are asking your dog to actively do stuff and he knows that lunging at children will mean losing out on the reward he knows he's getting if he just keeps still that little bit longer. The long term solution is what's called desensitization and counter-conditioning. In short, it means gradually getting your dog used to whatever triggers the fear reaction (and it is fear 99% of the time rather than aggression) while at the same time associating the trigger with positive outcomes. Practically, it means you'll want to recruit someone's child to help you, since children seem to be the trigger. The main thing to do is to make this training exercise safe for the child, your dog and yourself, so ideally set it up with a fence between the dog and the child, so the dog can't get at the child even if you lose control of the leash. Find the distance at which your dog is still comfortable with the child, i.e. well before it starts lunging or showing any other warning signals (growling, raised heckles, etc.). While you are at a comfortable distance, whenever the dog looks over to the child, reward it with lots of praise and food (or a toy, if that's what motivates your dog). Really hammer it home that good things happen when it looks at the child and doesn't react. The best way to do this (if your dog is food motivated) is to give him a special type of treat, the nicest you can find, that he only gets when he is around children and behaves himself. Don't use this type of treat for anything else! Once your dog is happy with the child at a certain distance and realises good things happen with the child around, move a step closer. Really go slowly, as getting it wrong will undo a lot of work up to that point. When you do get it wrong and your dog reacts to the child, lead it away to a safe distance and start again. Don't punish the dog! You're the one who pushed it too quickly into a situation the dog is not comfortable with. Simply go back to a distance the dog is OK with and start again. Do this for 5-10 minutes, then wait until the next day. Gradually build up your dog's resistance to children and slowly associate them as being good for it. Keep in mind that this might be a long and slow process for the simple reason that when you're actually out on a walk and your dog is forced into a situation it's not comfortable with (children have the unfortunate tendency of wanting to pet even the most fearsome and aggressive looking dogs) and it lunges, the kid will probably run away, meaning the dog's response just got reinforced and you have to undo that again. Dog is scared of kid, dog lunges, kid runs away => dog achieves desired outcome.
29	There are a lot of toys on the market designed to stimulate cats who are stuck in indoor environments, and usually they are designed to mimic behaviours that cats use outside and in the wild, etc. Some suggestions you might want to try that don't involve buying possibly expensive toys that your cat might not like are: give it food to hunt. I often use cat treats, which I can hide in boxes or paper bags or the like and my cat will hunt them down. He likes both the box/bag to play in, and the hunting the food. give it something to climb and/or scratch on - if your cat is like other outdoor cats I know, they likely like climbing on whatever they find (fences, trees, etc), and trying to mimic that inside with a cat tree or something similar might help. if she likes string, you might want to consider a toy that is on a string - you can get ones that are on sticks that you hold, or you can also find ones that you can mount over a door or in a door frame that they can chase and pounce.
30	Dogs are territorial and will protect their area whenever there is some natural or an artificial border separating their territory from not their territory. Most of them aren't too aggressive at that tho, and if you opened the fence doors you'd likely observe your dog bark while a passer by walks next to the fence, and stop soon after they pass by the open door. That might not be possible to do in your case, but you have probably observed this behaviour previously with other dogs behind fences. I'm describing this to somewhat lower your expectations, because you're unlikely to stop your dog barking at passers by when they approach some barrier they learned to protect, adopted as their territory. When I say learn, large part of this behaviour would be preconditioned and greatly depends on the dog species, and when I say their territory, some dog species that are more lenient to strangers approaching might be more permissible in all of this. So one way to prevent that would be distancing your dog from the fence itself, maybe by building a kennel within that fence but far enough from it for the dog to feel comfortable with strangers passing by (it would depend on each individual dog really, even their pecking order if you have more than one), but I would advise against chaining your dog or anything of that sort, not to cause it further inconvenience. The dog is really merely doing its job when barking at strangers. And strangers here means any passers by that the dog didn't yet successfully identify on their approach. Different dog breeds will have different sight, smell and hearing abilities, so this will vary too. Alternatively, if at all possible, move your fence to be slightly protruding onto the street, at least a bit more than your neighbour's so the dog can see, smell and hear incoming passers by before they nearly brush against your fence and surprise your dog, making it bark even more vigorously. Or even the other way around, recess your fence inwards so there's enough of space between the pathway beyond the fence and the fence itself. Anyway, there are many ways to help prevent or lower the frequency of this barking through the fence, once you know where this behavior originates from. Observe your dog, allow it to move freely on your lawn and take a mental note of when the dog doesn't feel threatened by passers by, and when it does. Then apply these rules learned to whatever would keep your dog from barking through the fence. Some breeds tend to be more nervous while others might be easier to apply any of these rules to and mitigate this problem. Terriers are particularly territorial (not where the name comes from, tho), also shepherds but usually when there's something else than themselves to protect within the protected area, and some hounds or similar might not even give any attention to passers by. As a general rule of a thumb though, bigger dog breeds tend to be more confident in themselves and be slower, less energetic in their reactions to strangers. Unless they feel they really have to. So, learn your dog's ways and you two will work together on it, figure it out. ;)
31	This is a common behaviour. There are a few different ideas as to why cats seem to like shoes in particular as stash locations. They are small spaces that seem hidden, which cats like - they want to hunt things and then hide them for later, and the shoes seem like a good sneaky way to hide them away from the other people in the house (or other animals), as they are small and hard to see into and easy to overlook. They are bringing you a present! Cats tend to hunt and bring the kills to whoever they care for (other cats, people, etc), and since your shoes will retain a lot of your personal scent, especially if they are ones you wear often, the cat will associate them with you, and thus put the toys there for you to find as gifts and proof of their hunting prowess.
32	I use the squirt bottle technique, a little squirt of water doesn't hurt them, but it discourages the behaviour. However, maybe it's just that my cats are especially intractable, but it's usually a short-term dissuasion in my experience. Just make sure that they don't see you squirt them, it may affect their reaction.
33	As a child I've always picked up snails by their shell. No matter if it were small snails or burgundy snails. Their houses are sturdy enough that you wont crush them when you pick them up, just apply enough pressure to safely grab it. Use as many fingers as you can so the pressure is distributed evenly. A snails foot is well protected by the mucus on it. They also secrete mucus from the foot to aid in locomotion by reducing friction, and to help reduce the risk of mechanical injury from sharp objects, meaning they can crawl over a sharp edge like a straight razor and not be injured. As long as you are careful and don't rip the snail away from the surface, you should be safe lifting the it slowly. As soon as you gently pull it, it should let go of whatever it foot attached to or if it is too light, light a small twig, you will lift that, too. Another way is to touch the snails antennas. This usually makes the snail retract into her shell which makes picking it up even easier. Of course you have to be careful not to hurt the snail.
34	The Humane Society of the United States has a few suggestions to prepare your pet. Some of them sound a little silly, but they do work. One of the most important things is getting the pet used to the new noises and sounds the baby will make - a lot of pets will find baby cries and the like upsetting. You can play crying sounds and the like to acclimate the pet, for example. As for actual introduction of the baby to the pet, they suggest first giving the animal something with the baby's smell on it (a blanket, etc) so they don't get alarmed by the new smell in the house, if possible. It is also suggested that you try to keep your pet's routine the same as much as possible, and that you greet the pet first without the baby when you arrive home with your new child. Basically, you want the pet to interact positively with the baby, so you will want to reward and encourage positive interactions, and at first you might want to limit the time the pet and the baby spend actively together. Bring the baby to sit with the pet, etc (with you holding the baby, of course), for small bursts, extending them over time, as the pet gets used to the baby.
35	I would say start by familiarizing the dog with the baby's scent. Bring an item that contains your baby's scent, such as a burp rag before bringing the baby around the dog. Have the dog sniff it from a distance at first preferably. By doing this, you are communicating to your dog that the item is yours and then giving permission for the dog to sniff. This helps start the process of creating respect for the baby. Be very careful also as dogs have been known to attack children for particularly no reason, the noise might excite them or they might be overly rough when playing around etc. There are many articles around the web. I suggest not leaving the dog with the toddler and paying attention to how he behaves around the baby, if seeking attention, dogs can get restless and this can lead to accidents. Other general tips are to: Pay attention to your dog when around the toddler and make sure you are in a controlled environment. Observe and become aware of how the dog seeks your attention. Know your dog’s sensitivities. Research the breed or mixes. Does he startle with fast motion, noises etc. Allow your dog to become familiar with the baby equipment.
36	This is a very tricky problem for the simple fact that your dog gets rewarded every time it barks at a passerby. In the dog's head, it's all very simple. Person approaches, dog barks, person leaves. Yay to the power of barking! Depending on the size of your garden, if none of TildalWave's suggestions are an option, you might have to temporarily keep your dog in the house while you're not at home and in a room that doesn't allow him to bark at passersby through the window. The long-term approach is to use desensitisation and counter-conditioning, that is, slowly get your dog used to strangers coming near the fence and start to associate strangers with good things happening(TM). You'll have to recruit some strangers (to your dog) and ask them to approach the fence to a distance that your dog is comfortable with. Reward your dog for noticing the stranger but not barking at it. Slowly move the dog and/or stranger closer together and keep rewarding good behaviour. Try to set your dog up for success as much as possible. The less often you get your dog's threshold wrong, the quicker it'll learn. Also, it is very important for the stranger not to move away if your dog does start barking, as this will only reinforce the unwanted behaviour. Just ask the person to stay still and move your dog further away from the fence. Most of all, exercise plenty of patience as it might take a while.
37	He may be finding the engine noise distracting or irritating (same can be said for human reaction too) and so is vocalizing his displeasure as a result. I have to be honest, I don't think I've heard of this before, so it may be worth having his hearing and ears checked to be safe.
38	In addition to John Cavan's answer, if you've ruled out any medical problems your dog most likely howls at the plane to make it go away - and it's working! If planes pass over your house frequently enough, you'll want to desensitise your dog to the noise. Try searching for airplane noises on YouTube and play them at a volume that your dog is comfortable with. Reward with lots of treats and praise. Increase the volume in very small steps, as you will undo a lot of the work if you misjudge your dog's limits and he starts howling. Have lots of patience, it'll likely take a while for your dog to get used to the noise and to associate it with good things happening(TM).
39	According to various pet behaviourists, dogs' Circadian rhythms are generally set around the amount of daylight rather than time, as they lack the ability to differentiate between say, 6 PM and 7 PM the way humans do. This is mitigated some by the artificial light cycles (you turning lights on and off, etc) in your home. Your pet might notice the change and will likely take a bit to adjust, but generally they do adjust to the differences (in daylight, timing, etc.) which come with Daylight Savings time. If you like, you can choose to slowly adjust the pet's schedule, but generally the pet should be okay with the time change. Like humans, pets will need time to adjust, but they generally figure it out.
40	I've found that my rabbit loves to eat timothy hay, bananas, slightly peeled grapes, mostly stuff that's sweet. He hates veggies. Tried most kinds of greens that are available in the grocery store. Other than timothy hay, the rabbit will not eat anything green. He even has a preferred brand. Here is a complete list of dos and don'ts that I've found in terms of food.
41	You can use a magnetic fish tank cleaner (one example). It consists of two pieces that use magnets to attach through the glass. One piece is often shaped like a grip, the other piece has a surface used to clean off the algae. You have to be careful the cleaning surface is free of sand or other dirt, otherwise you might scratch the glass. There are floating versions available which don't drop down to the bottom of the aquarium if the pieces lose contact. This reduces the risk of getting sand onto the surface and makes it easier to retrieve the piece that's in the water.
42	Generally speaking, if you are not familiar with the water source, it is not safe to let your dog drink from it. Leptospira, which is a genus of bacteria excreted in the urine of infected animals, can survive for many months in water ways, so our vet has recommended that in addition to his normal annual shots, he also be inoculated for leptospirosis. Beyond the additional inoculations, our vet has not shown any serious concerns though. However, it is always advisable to consult with your vet as there may be pathogens that are common to waterways where you live.
43	This has to do with security. A box has 4 sides so they feel safe and protected since they are closed off. It also gives them the element of surprise and if anything happens they can easily escape/attack etc. (src) They like the security of an enclosed space. A box resembles a cave and may make your cat feel secure knowing they are protected and, theoretically, cannot be attacked from behind. Boxes are fun! Lots of cats seem especially playful in and around boxes. Cats enjoy jumping in and out of a box, pouncing, stalking and climbing atop boxes. Cats are little predators, and a box is a great spot from which to pounce on their prey, even if the prey is just a catnip mouse toy. Boxes are cozy. Try putting a soft blanket in the bottom of your cat’s favorite box. The sides help retain the cat’s body heat making a comfy nest. (src)
44	Try to break up your problem into a set of small easy steps and work on each one separately. For example, to try and get your dog to overcome the fear of noises from the TV start with the TV set to very low volume. Play a movie, and hang out with your dog, feeding her yummy treats repeatedly. Make sure you start out with a very low volume level, and a very high frequency of rewards. At this point you are trying to get your dog to focus on the food and not the noise, so it is fine to give lots of treats (use something cheap, and break it up to small, pea sized, bits. One good option is string cheese cut to small pieces). Slowly decrease the rate of rewards. Can you get to a point in which you only give her a treat once every 10 seconds? 30? 60? Then increase the volume a bit, and go back to fast rewards. Continue until she is ok with normal TV volume. If at any point she starts showing signs of stress/fear (cowering, lip licking, etc) go back a step - reduce volume and give more rewards. For walking outside. Again, break the problem into small steps. Getting the leash, getting out the door, standing close to the house and watching cars drive by, standing on the sidewalk, walking on the sidewalk, and so on. reward heavily for each 'small step' at first. You are trying to build a connection in your dog's mind between these strange (possibly scary) noises to good things - namely treats.
45	There are a few types of fish that feed on algae, and some are pretty cool looking. I've found this list of algae-eaters, which is a great list because it lets you know whether your existing fish will find them tasty. Some examples: Otocinclus sp. American flagfish Neritina sp. zebra snail Whiptail catfish.
46	Ultimately positive praise, reward, and repetition are the keys. When taking him out after meals, try to direct your dog to the particular area in which you would like him to relieve himself. You will have to stay with him and try to encourage him to remain in that area until he goes. Once he does, provide him with positive praise and rewarding him (food rewards obviously will work best). And keep repeating until he picks up on the idea. However, just like with paper training an apartment dog or regular house-breaking, accidents will happen. It is important that you do not punish him for going where you don't want him to go, especially very early in the training. It will only confuse him and possibly associate the punishment with going to the bathroom, which will complicate matter significantly.
47	Feral cats can be domesticated, but that is somewhat dependant on why they're feral in the first place. A cat born wild is likely to stay mostly that way even if it is comfortable with other cats or one human. A cat that is feral because it was "kicked out" or abandoned is more amenable to human contact and can be brought back to comfort with humans as a result. My in-laws have done this successfully with about a half dozen rescues and our current cats are offspring from one of those successes, it just requires a lot of patience and a willingness to sit still for it. I did a similar thing for a persian that was badly abused and was deathly afraid of men, eventually he was the biggest suck of a cat you could meet. In terms of your Mom's cat, it may never entirely get comfortable with people and not all cats are keen to be petted either. The puppy represents a disruption to routine as well and some cats really hate that, so that may be the real reaction rather than specifically the puppy. Mind you a nutty dog in a dignified cat's "space" may be sufficient offence anyways. :D
48	Oddly enough, it could be the color of their fur. A study has shown that darker color cats are more likely to induce an allergic reaction: While the reason is unclear, researchers at Long Island College Hospital in New York speculate that darker cats may produce more of an allergen called fel d 1 in their skin and saliva than do lighter colored felines. A study of 321 patients found that those who owned dark-colored cats were up to four times more likely than those with light-colored cats or no feline friends to suffer moderate or severe allergy symptoms, according to a report to be published in the Annals of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology. Then again, as is often the case with science, another study has reportedly found the exact opposite result. There is a study titled Fel d 1 levels in domestic living rooms are not related to cat color or hair length, but I cannot find details of the actual study (possibly due to the current government shutdown). It is possible that the previous study may have simply been too small, and insufficiently randomized, as the cohort was only 321 patients. According to yet another study, it is also possible that male cats may produce more fel d 1 than female cats, and intact males may produce more than neutered males. In any case, fel d 1 levels do seem to be the most likely culprit. Since the hormone is secreted in saliva and from the sebaceous glands, it is most abundantly produced during grooming. To mitigate your friend's exposure, you can try to keep him away from areas where the cats are most likely to groom themselves.
49	Among the things harmful to cats, the American Humane Association states the following: Cats tend to be attracted to unusual flavors, so keep them away from calamine lotion, diaper rash ointments, sunblock and analgesic ointments. These products contain an acid related to those in aspirin and will prove toxic if ingested. The ASPCA Animal Poison Control Center also says that: We would not expect to see problems as a result of your cats coming into contact with your hands after you've applied non-medicated lotion. Should they happen to ingest a small amount of this lotion, it could potentially have a bit of a laxative effect, and may cause stomach upset. However, we would not anticipate systemic or life-threatening problems. So in general, if it is a non-medicated lotion, you should be safe. It's not something the cat should likely get a lot of, but if they are just licking your skin after you have applied it and it has soaked into your skin, the cat should be okay. However, if the cat suddenly appears to be ill after licking the lotion, taking proper steps to ensure its safety and health are always top priority, of course!
50	My cat does a similar thing, except his curls some instead of being flat over his back. According to my vet, this sort of thing, where the tail rests on their back, is a genetic mutation that some cats have. It isn't painful and doesn't cause them any harm, it is just a difference in how their tail rests on their body. Most cats cannot pull their tail over themselves in that particular way, as their body structure prevents it, but your cat (and mine, and many others) were just born with a mutation that allows them to do this.
51	Your cats are still closer to kitten than to true adult and they want to hunt and pounce for practice. Strings make convenient and easy to grasp, in their jaw, targets and the toys probably helped to demonstrate that. Worse yet, for the hunt and pounce activity, is that moving laces are even more of a challenge for cats looking for fun and practice. So, my experience with cats suggests that you've now established that idea with them and that's a habit that's going to be hard to break, but they'll probably ultimately outgrow it as they get more interested in someone else hunting for them... you. :D
52	I found a stray puppy some months back at the gate to my home and she was covered with fleas and cuts. She kept biting herself and would also wimper in pain. You could see the fleas in her fur, they were huge. First, I got a small empty aerosol bottle with a spray nozzle and bought a small bag of flea powder (the generic stuff you can get at any store, nothing special). I mixed this with luke-warm water and sprayed her with it for until she was fully doused. About a half-hour later she was fast asleep and when she woke up I noticed she wasn't scratching as much or gnawing at her ankles or rear end as much. The next day I got some flea shampoo and soaped her up, careful to avoid her eyes and mouth and held her in a bath of warm water for about a minute or so before rinsing and drying her off in a towel. Note: It is important that you shampoo the head thoroughly especially around the eyes and ears as fleas tend to migrate to those areas when exposed to water and this can be very painful for the animal being treated. I didn't see her scratching out of the ordinary after that. Within a month, her fur had smoothed out and she had a healthy coat again also sans the wounds she had previously. I also tend to dust around her kennel every now and then with the same generic flea powder and make sure it is swept and kept clean. Shampooing or spraying a larger or friskier animal might not be so easy and I have never tried this on any other pet I have but I can say without a doubt that it worked. Also, I had never brought her into the house prior to the treatment so no specific advice on that except to perhaps dust corners and gaps in your house, disinfect areas the animals frequent and perhaps also vacuum.
53	I think she misses you. Dogs are pack animals and you're part of her pack. When you leave, she has effectively been separated from her pack and that can be very distressing. One way to address that is to add to the pack, another dog, but if you can't do that, then another animal (surprisingly, even a cat) may give her that sense that she's not alone enough for her to stop. I don't think, without that pack substitute, you're going to have a huge amount of luck working her out of it.
54	You should consider adding some natural pH reducing element. Adding drift woods, indian almond or oak leaves will slowly leach tannins, which in turn will reduce the pH. If you have a planted tank, you can start injecting CO2 which will also lower the pH. Another option is to filter the water through peat moss or commercially available peat granules.
55	I have kept all kinds of tetras: cardinal tetras; rummy-nose tetras; balloon red eye tetras; penguin tetras with neons; black neons without any problem. Apart from the tetra species, you can keep harlequin rasboras, nerite snails and Amano shrimps as well.
56	When determining the capacity of an aquarium, it is common to look at total fish length rather than number of fish. The idea is that bigger fish need more room. The rule-of-thumb I've always used for freshwater tropical fish is 1 inch of fish length per gallon of water (or about 25 mm of fish length per 4 liters). However, this can vary greatly based on the species of fish. Some fish need more room than others.
57	There is no general rule of thumb and it depends on the fish you plan to keep. Some fish can live in small volume of water while some need larger roaming areas. For example: Oscars/Flowerhorns require at-least 40 gallons per adult/semi-adult fish while African Cichlids are suggested to keep in a dense pack to reduce their aggression. As for tropical fishes (guppies, tetras etc), you should aim for a gallon of water per inch of fish.
58	If the algae is brown in color (diatom), has already settled and is hard; magnetic cleaners or algae-eating species wont be of much help. You can wrap a small piece of cloth around your hand and simply rub it off. You can also use an old toothbrush. Once the algae is off the glass, you can then use a magnetic cleaner or introduce algae-eating species as a maintenance/cleaning crew.
59	Other than avoidance, there may be a few things you can do. One thing that is sometimes recommended is oatmeal, similar to how it is recommended to relieve itching for humans with chicken pox. Grind it to a fine powder, and if the dog allows it, either soak the animal in water mixed with the oatmeal, or rub the animal down (gently!) with a damp cloth and some of the oatmeal.
60	After meals, I take my dog to a particular place, somewhere near a field in my house. I say to him in my mother tongue for him to poo. As you all know, pets follow reflex actions, after somedays practice he will understand what you want him to do. But sometimes, I also observe rather than you picking an appropriate place for him, he will choose one himself, which is most likely you would find appropriate too. In day 1 , if he poos somewhere you think okay, take him to that place on day 2 too and say him to poo and try not to let him someplace else go. If he poos, 99% sure he will mark that place and from day 3 he will take you himself there. Also, praise and appreciate your dog when he poos. Give him rewards, that way, he would better understand you. Best of luck :-)
61	You can't expect your pet to keep mum if you are not with him. Solutions: Get the dog someone to give him company. When there is no one at home, you can consider leaving him at some neighbors home awhile. You can request somebody to look after him while everybody has gone from your house. You can provide him something to play with. This is not very effective in every cases. But in 50% cases, it would work. Give a bone toy or a ball to chew with. My own dog likes to play with them and we got rid of the barking problem. Dogs do not like being locked. Just letting him be may work.
62	Frankly speaking in my experience, you can't really discourage your dog to not drink from the stream you mentioned. I see and I don't know exactly why but dogs like drinking from foul places. We tried to resist our dog and even tried to reward him if he drinks from the vet meant for him but really, this is one case where we could not really discourage him. However if you talk about health, we haven't found a clue which tells us that he felt ill for that. So if the source of water is clean, there is nothing to panic about. However, which owner does not want his dog to be distant from foul places? In that case, I would suggest taking physical measures (such as boundary or fence in your garden) to resist him from going there.
63	Rabbits are generally very cautious by nature, and when startled can leave a trail of droppings involuntarily. These are usually dry and easy (although understandably inconvenient) to clean up. It may be the case, that since these new areas are "unfamiliar territory" your rabbit is possibly getting spooked when its exploring. If possible monitor the situation and see if it improves with time. Alternatively, it may be attempting to mark its territory. While this is cute when they "chin" objects, droppings are less fun. However, again over time, when given the opportunity to feel at home in an area this behaviour should disappear. Likewise, try and slowly introduce areas to your rabbit. Set up gates so they can only explore smaller areas and retreat to safety easily.
64	I have had very good luck with two different obese cats using a Tiger Diner cat bowl. They have to work for their food, so they eat more slowly and feel like they are eating more, one of my cats started actually leaving food when using the Tiger Diner. The various food balls and feeder toys are also good. One of the obese cats I've dealt with is also very nervous about food. One thing that helps is to put part of her dry food in one of the timed 'vacation' feeders. She knows that there is food in it and trusts that she will get it eventually but can't eat it right now. This allows her to relax and not stress about getting food. Although it did not work for us, my vet recommended making a broth of water and wet food and offering that in addition to or instead of water. This has the benefit of getting more water into your cat (most cats don't drink enough water) and makes them think they are getting food without a lot of calories. If you can do so without making your overweight cat too nervous, feeding the timid cat in a place too small for the other cats might be helpful as well.
65	She is probably lonely. Also, she wants to protect the territory - and since the rest of her pack is away, she must do so herself. In addition to the great suggestions by @Mistu4u, you could make a recording of your own voice, and have that play while you're gone. 4 or 5 hours might be a bit long, but for shorter periods of time this could work. (I'd prefer to try @Mistu4u's suggestions first though). If the dog can't be brought to the neighbours, they can still help - if the dog can hear them and they can hear the dog, they can talk to her to comfort her.
66	(Here is what the animal rescue service explained, asked them when they picked him up). The bird is scared and nervous now. If you give him food or water, he may eat or drink too excitedly, and he can choke on that. You can give him a little water, but be sure that it is just a little, not enough for him to choke on.
67	Most fruit tree wood (I have heard mixed reviews on Cherry wood, so I avoid it) is both extra tasty to rabbits and healthy for them to chew on. You could have a special chew stick or branch that (once it has been introduced as a special yummy treat) only comes out when the guests do. You might start with it further away from guests and then move it closer as bunny relaxes more. The weight of fruit at harvest usually brings down some branches and winter is pruning time for fruit trees, so now is a good time to line up some wood to collect.
68	It can can bring about a change behavior, but in our Collie-cross' case, it hasn't changed his behavior one bit (apart from not cocking his leg). I guess the optimum age really depends on each individual case. In any case, the minimum age you can desex a male dog is 8 weeks. Most vets will recommend waiting until at least 6 months.
69	To be honest, this just sounds like normal puppy behavior. They have limitless energy, much more than any of us I'd bet. Our collie-cross had the same issues (still does to some extent, if we let him away with it, at 10 months). There are loads of things you can try, but unfortunately there will be no magic one-stop calming device: Get him used to people. Bring friends round, bring him to puppy classes. If humans and attention are what excites him, more interaction may take the sting out of the hyperactivity after a while. This however is a slow process and will take some time. Try find a toy which occupies him. I found it difficult to find toys suitable for puppies which my dog was interested in, but you might have better luck. Sounds like you're definitely exercising him enough. Try putting him in his part of your flat when you come back from a walk. Let him calm down. Then once he's calm, bring him in and ignore him. I'll bet eventually he will fall asleep The most important thing to remember is that as long as you socialize & exercise him, eventually he will calm down, it'll just take time.
70	This is a tricky problem, most pet owners face. I have not been able to eradicate fleas entirely, without the use of some man-made chemical, but have found many natural solutions to use on my pets for most of the time. To combat fleas, one has to treat the entire environment of the pets and all the pets that can carry fleas. I do this annually, at the beginning of the flea season (warming weather). This process requires a whole day of good weather, and can be done over a weekend, but I recommend doing it concurrently, so as not to give fleas a hidey hole to wait in. Treating the pets: Each pet needs to be bathed individually. I have using chemicals on them, and do not like topical additives to the skin or food. Depending on the sensitivity of the pet's skin I vary this regime. Using warm water and I like the laundry tub for smaller animals as there is plenty of access to fresh water to thoroughly rinse. It is important to thoroughly wet the pet all over, as fleas will climb to an animals head, if it is submersed in water. If fleas are the only issue, I bath in a variety of solutions: If dirt is also an issue: A eucalyptus woolmix (for washing woolen clothing), which needs to be thoroughly rinsed off. The eucalyptus acts as a natural flea deterrent. For sensitive skin a mixture of oats and warm water or other remedies. The flea mixture: After any premix has been thoroughly rinsed I use a combination of the following, I don't give a definitive combination, as it depends on the animals skin and sensitivity and so this is something that becomes a bit of trial and error and finding the optimal mix for each individual pet. - tea tree oil - eucalyptus oil - lavender oil I keep all these three oils in continuous stock in my home, as they are very useful and all act as deterrents to fleas, especially the tea tree. To make the mixture with the oils, if using an 8 litre bucket, I would add a little less than half a capful of lavender, a half capful of eucalyptus and one or two capfuls of tea tree. I then saturate the entire pet with a washer, including between toes, groin area, around eyes and ears (being careful not to get the solution in the eyes or ears. and allow this to dry on the pet. I do not allow them to go and roll in the dirt. I tie them up in the sun for a short while. I find it's better not to towel dry. This can be done throughout the flea season, as often as weekly but I would recommend reducing the levels of oils in the solution for subsequent frequent washes, to avoid skin irritation. Tea tree can be used in stronger mixtures to spot kill fleas. You just need to keep and eye on your pets skin. A stronger mixture of tea tree, 50:50 with water (which is also expensive) can be used on pets with flea infestations. It is not advisable to let the solution stay on the pet fro more than 20 minutes, but to rinse it off, to avoid skin irritation. Treating the Environment: Unfortunately when treating the environment, I have not found a non-chemical solution, but have been using this same regime for some decades now. Internal environment: I take a warm day when I know the pets can be safely left outside after their treatment, whilst the inside is treated. When the weather warms and the first flea jumps and bites from the environment. All carpets and bedding need to be vacuumed and/ or washed. Not just pet beds and bedding, but blankets and bedding of children and adult beds, lounges if the pets are part of the family and sleep on these things. The pets and humans need to be removed from the house and I use flea bombs. I ensure that I use enough to cover the entire house, and place them up high in strategic positions so the gas will diffuse into all the rooms. I do this for any vehicles the pets travel in. Vehicle need to be bombed so that any portals between boots and cabin can be opened and the bomb can infuse the entire vehicle. A car requires a longer time to air after using a flea bomb and needs a safe place that all doors and windows can be left open for some hours. External Environment: I use a tough chemical on all concrete and paved surfaces around the house. Any basic flea mixture for surfaces can be mixed with warm water, as per directions and left to dry. When the area has a flea plague, fleas will be in the grass and there is not much that can be done to prevent this, except to try and keep pets indoors and let them run in off leash areas that are not plagued, weather the warmer months and hope the next season is better.
71	I am not an expert, just happened to have lived the same thing a couple of months ago. Your dog needs to have a spot for himself, a basket or something similar, where you can send him. This should never be used as a punishment but a place for him to "hang out". Once the order of "go to your basket" is learnt, it will be a lot easier for you to help your dog calm down. Chances are that, at 8 weeks old, his mom did not get all the time to teach him to return to calm. If your doggy wants to play it is a good sign! But make sure you are the one initiating all the play times. If he comes to you with a toy or just try to get your attention, ignore him, or even a "no" might be in order if he insists and 5 minutes later go play with him. This way you will be the one who controls, and you will teach your dog that bugging you to play is useless. It is also normal that your dog sleeps while you are not around. As most animals, when their needs are fulfilled and no other stimulant is around, they are recovering or saving energy to be ready if something happens. Don't forget dogs used to live in the wild :) Personally, I have found out that making him use his brain during playtime was a good way to make him learn, learn about him and tire him down somewhat quicker. My dog is now usually feeding off a plastic milk bottle (could be soda bottle, but the opening might be a bit too small), he cannot use his teeth on it at all. He has to bump it with his nose or use his paws to get some food out. I also mixed sit and a couple other orders during our games and he learnt a lot faster than when we tried with treats. Refs: Own personal experience, doggy is now 9 months old, still has as much energy but he knows (and us too now) to control it. A personal trainer was of big help to us too, most of what I stated is suggestions she made that we followed. Good luck, may the patience be with you
72	I am not sure about optimal age... But I know that even at 8 years old, dogs still may show a change of behaviour. Just to add to your thoughts, mine is 9 months old, it has been 1 month since the operation and he changed to all what people lead us to expect. He was very dominating, and if we refused him something he would let us know (We mainly invited that to happen in the first place as we did not know how to take care of a dog). Now he is still protecting the house but is very gentle with us. Some say the younger the better, and that 5-6 month is best, but we wanted to wait for him to "man up" a bit first... Don't know if it changed anything. Other question to ask yourself, is it a working dog? I doubt you'd desex a guard dog for instance.
73	People here has answered very well but if nothing helps then barking control collars can help as a last resort. I know its little rude to your pet but giving pet a company doesn't always helps and sometimes building/neighbor restriction can force you to do so with your pet. My sister Labrador also constantly barks when he is alone, even in presence of her second dog French mastiff. We didn't used the collars but there are some collars in market which doesn't give electric shock but just vibrate on barking which are less effective then electric collars but it doesn't harm the pet.
74	There's an answer to this on Cesar Millan's website from a vet. In short, some studies have shown a link between neutering a dog before 14 months of age and cancer/joint problems and other studies show benefits in early neutering. Edit: Here are a few more articles from the same website on spraying and neutering.
75	Okay, first I want to admit that I do not know if a general behavioral problem exists with French Mastiffs or not. But the problem you shared with us is kind of a "respect issue" i.e. when a dog does not show enough love/respect for another person in the house. How can you get through this? I would like to share with you from my own experience. Our German Shepherd dog Alex was brought to our house by my elder brother. As I had no experience in raising a dog earlier, my brother took the responsibility of raising him. But for work reasons, he had to go someplace else distant from our house. So I did all taking care of Alex during his absence. But whenever my brother used to return, he surely liked him more than me even if my brother stayed in our house for two weeks. So I thought to take some measures and discussing with my brother, who was ready to give the leadership to me, I took the following steps in order to get Alex's respect, love and attention. 1)Dogs follow one leader- It is not like the dog does not love you. Dogs love everybody in the family equally. It's that it's only in their nature, like any other animal, they tend to follow one particular leader. So one has to be the leader for his pet dog in order to get his full respect, love and attention. 2)Be the Leader and Take the Responsibilities- If you want to be the leader, take responsibility for him. You can't be a leader unless you look after him properly. The responsibilities include: a)Take the dog for outing for physical training b)Feeding, bathing, taking out for toilet, playing with him etc. c)Passing quality time with the pet et al. 3)Possess the quality of a Leader- It's in animals' nature to request permission or greet his proprietor. When you are the leader, you should act like one. For example, you should not greet your dog when you enter a room; you can pat him a little, look at him, touch him softly etc. but don't go for playing and fooling around with him when you are really busy. The dog can disturb you to get your attention like barking, playing near your body, etc. Make a strict eye-contact with him. He will understand your attitude and eventually leave the room. This way you can garner the respect of a leader in your dog's mentality. But DON'T EVER PUNISH HIM PHYSICALLY. It won't do any good. 4)Spend a lot time with him- This is a very basic principle in raising a pet. If you spend a lot of time with the pet, they start loving you. That's how the man who takes care of the pet gets more attention than the others. Make sure you follow these steps carefully. Hopefully you would notice a change in the pet for you.
76	Parrots will mimic the bird sounds they hear around them. The key to training a parrot to talk , is having the parrot in isolation from other birds. It is also vital to not have a mirror in the bird's cage, as the parrot will talk to itself, thinking it is another bird. Teaching a bird to talk requires patience and a lot of repetition. I have taught budgerigars to talk (in my youth, when I had time and patience). It requires repeating the same word or sound or phrase over and over, as often as possible to the bird; preferably looking at the bird within arms reach. It is a good idea to start out with a single word; so as you can get a quicker result, this is to encourage you to keep persisting, as the more complex the arrangement of sounds the longer it will take the bird to catch it. There are some interesting (and sad) cases of the Australian lyrebird imitating the sounds of chainsaws that are used to destroy native bush land.
77	It's not necessity to shoe a horse. In your case, I don't see a reason to shoe your horse. Shoeing is done when the horse is used for racing purpose or the horse is to be used on places where it is filled with stones and sands. You wrote your horses don't run on rough lands. Again, shoeing can give birth to infections around the nails often. Sometimes shoes can cause numbness in the long run at the exterior parts of a leg. Besides, it is a well known fact that shoes can create blood-flow problems in the shod places. So, I would suggest, avoid shoeing unless it's really necessary.
78	Ideally, you should start socialising a puppy in 3-17 weeks. But practically one can't do so. I, personally gave my puppy time to be adjusted to our house as well as our surrounding environment. Now you can start socializing him by the following steps: Use a collar to get a hold of your puppy and take him for outing. Make him accustomed to the paths, streets and the locality around your house. IMO it wouldn't be a good idea to let him introduce with a new dog on the very first day. He can get mixed up with all the new things. Keep your puppy out of children if he does not like them. Don't meet with unknown strange dogs. You can meet with a person of your acquaintance and invite him to meet with you in a field with his dog. When they both meet, 100% sure both of them will bark each other or the older one will bark at the younger one. If it is your dog who is barking, make him stop. If he does so, reward him. If the other dog also stops, let the two meet and sniff each other. If all goes well, they might play with each-other (Highly unlikely it would happen on the very first day.) Keep them meeting. If they don't stop barking at each other or lounge, leave the place and choose another dog the next day.
79	The wikipedia article on wing clipping is quite extensive. Not to be confused with pinioning - the removal of a joint on the birds wing. Advocates note that a properly done clip only trims the feathers and not the wings themselves, and is painless and temporary, lasting only until the next molt. The article also notes that you should clip feathers on each side equally so that the bird can keep its balance when it falls.
80	Puppies should be socialized as early as possible. A neat thing about puppies is that, when they are younger than roughly 5 months, most other dogs will tolerate a lot more of the behavior which characterizes puppies (overly excited and playful, sometimes rude). This is because dogs tend to sexually mature around 5-6 months. If you know of other dogs who are older, and who are well-adjusted and you trust them, I would let your dog just be herself around the older ones. The older dogs will correct your puppy if it does something rude or out-of-line, and your pup will "naturally" learn what is and isn't acceptable behavior. If you don't have access to older dogs like that, a dog park isn't a bad place to start. But beware that people tend to bring their dogs to dog parks without fully knowing how their dog will react. Just a few weeks ago, a friend's 8-month-old pup was viciously attacked by a 2-year-old dog, and the owner's comment was "we're trying to socialize him". In order for your puppy to grow up to be adept at socialization - both with dogs and humans - it is crucial to expose her as a young pup to many different dogs and humans, in many different situations. Doing so every day isn't out of the ordinary. And as always (especially with puppies), set your dog up for success: don't put her in dangerous situations, or in unknown environments with too many strangers at once. Simply start slow, keep things interesting and fun, and be sure to work on socialization early and often.
81	The only estimate I keep hearing on this topic is to feed fish as much as they can eat in about five minutes. As long as the fish eat nearly everything of the food it wasn't too much. I suggest to use floating food. It makes it far easier to keep track if everything is eaten and you train your fish to search for food on the top of the pond so they are visible more often. It is hard to estimate the amount of insects that are eaten by your fish. I simply would adjust the amount by above guideline. The biggest problem with overfeeding seems to be massive growth of algae, at least I have never heard of problems with obese goldfish.
82	Treats can be a very important part of training your bunny. Like many pets, bunnies can be motivated by attention and/or food rewards, so using treats can be a great training device. Any high-sugar treat like fruit should be only a small part of bunnies diet, so moderation is important. It has been recommended that fruit is not more than 10% of a bunnies diet. Carrots (also high in sugar) are recommended to be not more then 15% of the diet. For my pets, I try and keep the total of all high-sugar treats to not more then 5%; occasionally days will pass without added sugar. This makes the reward more effective and is better for bunny health. Depending on metabolism and/or proportionate to veggies, you should be limiting the amount of pellets your bunny receives to 1/4 to 1/2 cup pellets per 6 lbs. (2.7 kg) body weight. Part of this daily pellet allowance can be used as a treat, for general behavior, and for training. For the big events requiring high motivation, I use raisins. They keep well and are small enough that I can give as many as 3 daily for really difficult challenges. Your rabbit is very trainable so using a keyword when calling your bunny for a treat can be very rewarding for you both. When calling them, we use the word "quick" followed by their name. You don't need to have a high-sugar treat every time they come on command. Their being unsure if the reward will be high-sugar, providing a pellet or a pet will increase their responsiveness (this is why gambling can be so addictive). Remember, no amount of treat will entice a bunny into a situation that makes them feel threatened. Socialization of the bunny and moderation of the visitors behavior are both important parts of the interaction, and it sounds like you are doing a great job making this part of your process.
83	It varies, but cats and small dogs are generally considered to be old at the age of 7. Larger breed dogs tend to have shorter life spans and are considered to be old when they are approximately 6 years of age. Owners tend to want to think of their pet's age in human terms.
84	When is a human considered to be old? The answer really depends on the individual. The seven year rule is old and inaccurate. There are several other methods that take the life expectancy of dogs into account better, eg one dog-year equals five humans-years for small dogs and seven for bigger dogs. And then there are even some nonlinear metrics in determining a comparable age value. If you and your dog think that he is old, ie he behaves like an old dog, treat him as such. I don't think it is good to treat a juvenile and active dog of high age as if he was a broken senile. Of course you still have to be careful as older dogs, no matter how active they are, will still have age-related problems and are more prone to injury than younger dogs.
85	For male dogs, it doesn't seem to matter. Some behaviours will respond to castration, others won't, no matter the age of the dog: Castration was most effective in altering objectionable urine making, mounting, and roaming. With various types of aggressive behavior, including aggression toward human family members, castration may be effective in decreasing aggression in some dogs, but fewer than a third can be expected to have marked improvement. Age of the dog or duration of the problem behavior does not have value in predicting whether castration will have a beneficial effect. (Neilson et al., 1997) For female dogs, however, it seems that spaying them to early is associated with an increased risk of urinary tract infections: Because earlyage gonadectomy appears to offer more benefits than risks for male dogs, animal shelters can safely gonadectomize male dogs at a young age and veterinary practitioners should consider recommending routine gonadectomy for client-owned male dogs before the traditional age of 6 to 8 months. For female dogs, however, increased urinary incontinence suggests that delaying gonadectomy until at least 3 months of age may be beneficial. (Spain et al., 2004) References Neilson, Jacqueline C., Robert A. Eckstein, and B. L. Hart. "Effects of castration on problem behaviors in male dogs with reference to age and duration of behavior." Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association 211.2 (1997): 180. Spain, C. Victor, Janet M. Scarlett, and Katherine A. Houpt. "Long-term risks and benefits of early-age gonadectomy in dogs."

86	Dogs are social animals and they always love company. Without company, they want something to do, digging can be one of them. To control this, using a polite way is the best, by distracting him from acting those things. Like if you see your dog digging, distract him by giving him some toys or play with him etc. Giving him more of your company will be better. Losing a mate can be a reason for this behavior.
87	After this allergy season, my vet offered a suggestion to help prevent the reaction. She suggested wiping the dog down after he comes inside. This will help remove the pollen that is clinging to his fur and not give it a chance to irritate the skin. She suggested keeping a spray bottle of a vinegar/water solution near the door and immediately spray him down once he comes in, then pat him dry paper towels to remove the pollen. A clean towel will work too, but you don't want to reuse the same towel as you'll just be rubbing the pollen you removed earlier back onto the dog. I can say this has worked yet since we haven't had an opportunity to try it, but it sounds promising and we plan on doing this next spring.
88	8 years, would be a good average to concider your dog as "old" or "senior" but there are no real fixed age. Just the difference between the races' lifespan makes it easy to understand. Small dogs tend to live between 15 to 20 years as big dogs will live between 12 to 15. The reasons why I say 8 years old is the threshold is because that at about this age that dark dogs will start having gray hair. At that age, the dog's diet should be changed a bit and the adult food should be changed to senior food as per your dog's favorite brand will most likely point out.
89	Generally speaking, you can't control the shedding since it needs to happen. The best preventative measure you can take is to brush/groom the dog regularly to ensure that the old hair is removed. For dogs that get seasonal coats, it is important to groom them more frequently during the times their new coat is coming in. For dogs that continually shed (like your retrievers), it is an on-going thing. However, if you think your dog is shedding more than he should, examining his diet might be helpful as high quality food are important for a health coat. His regular food should consist of high quality proteins. Additionally, you can try to supplement his diet with a fatty acid supplement. They sell DHA pills for dogs, but my vet also suggested just giving him human DHA pills (which are cheaper) and just cutting the dosage. We just cut open the gel caps and squeeze a little on his food for meal times. But before you start giving him supplements because you think something is wrong, it is recommended you have a vet check him out first. And if it is just a matter of keeping the clean house, covering the furniture is the only remedy there.
90	I can't speak specifically for the cat and the bird, but based on my limited knowledge, they should be ok as long as they have sufficient food and water, and access to their respective toilet facilities. The dog however, needs to be managed separately. Food - you should not leave food out all the time for a dog. They need designated feeding times, otherwise they will generally gorge themselves. This is an instinctual behavior as wolves generally could go days between meals so it was necessary to ensure they have adequate energy in case the next kill was many days away. Exercise - unless you have a large house or a very small dog, it is unlikely they will get enough exercise to be left alone for an extended time. They need access to the outside to be able to keep themselves fit and to keep them from being destructive Bathroom - if your dog is paper trained, this is less of a short term concern, but typically, dogs need to relieve themselves frequently. When you are home, you will often put them out right before bedtime and then again first thing in the morning. If you are gone only for a few hours (just overnight) so he will not miss any meals or be forced to wait to "do his business" then you should be able to manage. But if you will be gone longer than 6-8 hours, it might be necessary to bring the dog with you, or have someone check in to let him out and possibly feed him. Depending on the dog, leaving him outdoors might be an option to handle the bathroom problem, but unless he is allowed to roam free in a fenced yard, then it will not solve the exercise issue (and even then I would be uncomfortable leaving a dog outside unchained in only a fenced yard as many dogs are smart enough to figure their way out if they want). And this will not solve the food problem, you'll still need to be back in time to feed him or have someone feed him. But ultimately unless it is an outdoor dog (one that is kept outside all the time), then leaving him alone on his own is not recommended. He will either be barking or will be very uncomfortable and stressed at the forced confinement in an unfamiliar situation. And theft of the animal becomes a concern here as well.
91	I am not going to reiterate the advice given in the answers by @iKlsR and @Ashley. I want to add some more information; this is less of a solution, but more a cautionary tale. This is a tricky question, as there is no real way of predicting the outcome of how a pet will receive the first newborn (or even subsequent newborns) into the family. When my first child was a baby, we bought a Rottweiler, he was a beautiful dog, and well trained in obedience. Our second child was not born for another 6 years (approx) and the dog never accepted the new baby. Our newborn would make little noises and the dog would growl. We had to keep the dog and the baby separated at all times. I could not risk allowing the dog to be near the baby, as the dog made it clear he did not like him. We loved the dog (and the baby) so kept both separated. We then had our third baby about 18 months after the second! Well, needless to say the dog never met this baby. There were then two events which were defining and heart breaking. The dog growled at me, when I went near his food bowl while he was eating. I was the dog's master, I was the pack leader, and had obedience trained him, walked him, bathed him, fed him and loved him! I had specifically trained him to allow me to take food from his mouth! Any food, bone etc and to be able to handle him in any humane manner; as I had seen cases of dogs not allowing owners to touch certain parts of their bodies. He was feeling left out, and as an aging 55 kg Rottweiler he was becoming arthritic and not his happy easy going younger self. One day I was with my little son, a toddler now and we had a iron gate. The dog was on one side of the gate and I with my son on the other. My little boy loved the dog and tried to reach through the bars to pat him. The dog snapped at him. It was an agonizing time and with consultation with the local Veterinarian that I had to make the decision to euthanize my dog. This was the same dog that loved and protected our first baby throughout his life. Now this is a Rottweiler, he weighed the same as I did at that time and the amount of damage he could inflict would be far greater than a pug. Also, they are known to be more aggressive, having said that, I never totally trust any breed of dog outright with children, based on the notion of it being that particular breed. Dogs don't have hands, cannot speak English and communicate (in part) with their mouths; through sound and with their teeth. This is something that should always be remembered when introducing dogs to babies. Dogs are pack animals, and this is one of the leading issues with behaviour problems with dogs (their perception that they are higher ranking members of the packs than their humans). Your dog will have a firm notion of where he fits into his human pack. Some dogs do not accept an infant as part of the pack or a protected pack member (as offspring). Some dogs also become jealous of the attention bestowed on the infant. These two things may sound like they are the same thing, but they are actually subtly different. Bearing these factors in mind I would follow the advice of the other answers and make sure you give your dog plenty of pats and show him how happy you are whenever you walk n the door. Good luck.
92	It is natural for a dog to have a light smell, I wouldn't bathe a dog unless it got dirty. Most dirt can simply be rubbed off the fur by using a dry towel, which I would prefer to bathing. Dogs are waterproof, so as long as you are not using soap there isn't much to worry about. Our Labradors used to jump into every water source available, no matter how cold or smelly. If you need to use soap, be sure to use a soap that is approved to be used on dogs. There are special soaps available in most pet stores or online that don't affect the protective layers on the skin too much.
93	General Rule: Whatever the breed is, it is advisable not to bathe your dog more than once a month unless otherwise instructed by a vet using proper shampoo and soap. If you bathe a dog too often, its coat will lose shine and the dog can become itchy. Also, dog has a natural coat protecting system which can get harmed by over-bathing. So, once a month is preferable. However, we bathe our German Shepherd twice a month and I haven't experienced anything problematic about it. As far as the smell goes, it is very natural for a dog to have some smell. It should not bother you.
94	Something is bothering your cat and he does not like it. When this happens you should leave him alone and wait for him to relax. DO NOT try to calm him down with playing or food because, just like you said, he will think bad behavior will result in a reward. Some possibilities that can make him angry is another cat outside, a bug, or he just wants to be left alone.
95	Yes, these parasitic mites can be a vector for illness because they're effectively feeding on your snake. They're white when young, but will turn dark once they feed and would become easier to see, but they'll also be irritating the snake quite a bit. In the linked article there is some information on treatment, which is basically to bathe the snake and, possibly also oil him. You should also treat the housing area to remove the mites. Some good information on treating your snake can be in this article: Dealing with Snake Mites.
96	It does sound like your cat is upset about something, and trying to communicate it to you. Try to take note of what's happening immediately preceding these bouts. Is his food dish full? Is his litter clean? Has he been meowing at you, or trying to get your attention? Were you interacting with someone or something else prior? I've seen cats attack their owners (the attacks ranging from swatting with claws out, as you described, to full ambushes from behind, with claws latched onto the persons temples, and teeth buried in the top of their head!) over everything from getting affectionate with the person's significant other (making the cat jealous) to leaving the litter box too full. Until you can find the trigger, one possibility is trying to scruff the cat when he attacks. This helps establish you as the dominant member of the family, while clearly communicating that the behavior is undesired.
97	I can only think of sharpening his nails. Like most other animals, dogs sharpen their nails by rubbing it in woods. Your furniture (if wooden) can be the reason for digging. If not, then it can be due to dog's natural instinct to dig holes. Dogs dig holes to make den for themselves. It is this way, they show that the place is his. They don't use that hole for toilet and use it for sleeping, resting etc. Frankly, I have never heard dogs digging into furniture; our dog, dig holes into soil. But hearing your problem, the cause may be either of the two possible reasons aforementioned.
98	First and foremost, I would suggest making sure that your children can, and will, perform regular chores every day without fail. If you don't already have a pet, then you can establish some other daily chore as a surrogate. If they're not already doing such a chore, you can assign a new one, and explain that you're doing so to see how they would handle the responsibility of a pet. Make sure they do the chore every single day. I'd suggest waiting at least a month, to make sure they don't lose interest over time, and you should probably avoid establishing a clear timeframe with them (its much easier to keep up that chore in the third week knowing you only have 7 more days until you get that pet you wanted!). You can also expose them to other aspects of taking car of pets by finding friends who have a pet of the type you are considering, and arranging for your children to help out with some of the less fun tasks. Walking someone else's dog (supervised), and then being responsible for picking up their droppings is a big test of a child's commitment, as would scooping litter for a cat, or cleaning out a rabbit's cage, or cleaning a fish tank. However, since it sounds like you already have a dog, then the best demonstration is that they simply take on the responsibility of feeding and walking your dog. Its fine if you supervise, particularly if they aren't physically big enough to safely walk your dog, but you should put them in charge of picking up the droppings and disposing of them safely. If they can't shoulder a portion of the burden of caring for a pet already in the household, they won't be ready for their own pet.
99	It's a lot of duty for one to have a pet on his own. Taking care of a pet requires the commitment to take a huge responsibility. But since you have a dog in your house, it is understandable that your children know that very well. I will say you give up some of the day-to-day duties to your children slowly of the current dog, see if they feel interested, in this case love to do the work is very much important and the love should come from inside of their own. Upon observing, if it appears to you that they are not unhappy in executing the duties and they really love to do the job, you can let them have their own pet. But again, don't try to push them to have one because if they are really reluctant, you will face problems after buying a pet. The responsibility for the new pet in turn can be added to your own burden. So decide wisely.
100	These are generally called Mats. They are particularly a problem with long haired cats, but short haired cats can get them too. They are more susceptible to them in the spring and fall when they are shedding their seasonal coats. Also, overweight cats might get them in parts they can't easily reach to groom (i.e. their back). Prevention is quite simple, just brush your cat regularly and they are unlikely to occur. The main goal is to facilitate shedding. I'd recommend a strong wire brush (often called a cat rake) for this, for example something like: The reason for this sort of brush is that it gets into their undercoat where mats generally develop. So when brushing your cat with this you want to be fairly aggressive (which they tend to like). The other advantages of regular brushing are that your cat will most likely love it, they will shed less (if your cat is indoors), santization (brushing out dirt / cat litter) and it will help prevent hairballs as well. As far as what causes them I am not entirely sure, but I think it is probably similar to "Why do cords always end up getting tangled?"
